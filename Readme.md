Requirement

- Bower
- Jekyll
- Compass
- Grunt

Run 2 terminal command (GitBash), run grunt serve, and run grunt on the other terminal.
To use livereload, use chrome as the browser and download livereload extension. Don't forget to turn on / activate while the local server is running.

Any changes on the file (configure to watch html / css / md changes) will trigger grunt to build the site and serve it to the local server reloading it automatically with livereload.
